This section defines a few concepts that are important for the
@sysname{} library and describes how they related to each other.

@table @dfn

@item Unit

@cindex unit
@anchor{term-unit} @dfn{Units} are a way to designate particular
sub-sequences of the sequence of all items in a buffer, often relative
to the point cursor.  For example, the @t{word} unit refers to a
sequence of non-whitespace, non-punctuation characters that follow (or
precede depending on the specified direction) the point cursor.

Sites, units and operations are the basic concepts from which most
desired behaviors can be constructed.  Here are a few examples:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .15 .15 .15 .4
@headitem Operation @tab Unit @tab Direction   @tab Arguments    @tab Equivalent Emacs command
@item     move        @tab item @tab forward   @tab              @tab @t{forward-char}                (@kbd{C-f})
@item     move        @tab item @tab backward  @tab              @tab @t{backward-char}               (@kbd{C-b})
@item     move        @tab word @tab forward   @tab              @tab @t{forward-word}                (@kbd{M-f})
@item     move        @tab word @tab backward  @tab              @tab @t{backward-word}               (@kbd{M-b})
@item     move        @tab line @tab forward   @tab              @tab @t{next-line}                   (@kbd{C-n})
@item     move        @tab line @tab backward  @tab              @tab @t{previous-line}               (@kbd{C-p})

@item     delete      @tab item @tab forward   @tab              @tab @t{delete-char}                 (@kbd{C-d})
@item     delete      @tab item @tab backward  @tab              @tab @t{delete-backward-char}        (@kbd{<backspace>})
@item     delete      @tab word @tab forward   @tab              @tab @t{kill-word}                   (@kbd{M-d})
@item     delete      @tab word @tab backward  @tab              @tab @t{backward-kill-word}          (@kbd{M-<backspace>})
@item     delete      @tab line @tab forward   @tab              @tab @t{kill-line}                   (@kbd{C-k})
@item     delete      @tab line @tab backward  @tab              @tab @t{kill-line} with @t{0} prefix (@kbd{C-0 C-k})

@item     change-case @tab word @tab forward   @tab @t{:capital} @tab @t{capitalize-word}             (@kbd{M-c})
@end multitable

The key observation is that operations, units and directions are mostly
orthogonal.  In other words, new operations and units that are defined
independently should still work together just fine in most cases.  This
relative independence is achieved via the
@ref{Generic-Function text.editing|apply-from-cursor, apply-from-cursor function}
which applies a given item-wise operation to a sub-sequence of buffer
items specified as a unit and a direction.
